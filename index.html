  <h1>Discipleship & Evangelism (DE) Group: Purpose and Goals</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The DE Group exists to cultivate a lifestyle of faithful discipleship and bold evangelism. Rooted in the Great Commission <span class="verse">(Matthew 28:19–20)</span>, this group is a space where believers are encouraged, equipped, and sent out to make disciples who make disciples. We gather to grow in intimacy with Christ and share His love with the world.</p>
  </section>

      <li>Growing in Christlikeness through Scripture, prayer, and accountability. <span class="verse">(Romans 12:2, 2 Peter 3:18)</span></li>
      <li>o	Practicing spiritual disciplines that shape our hearts and renew our minds. <span class="verse">(1 Timothy 4:7–8)</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FACT Qualities: The Kind of People We're Looking For</h2>

      <li><strong>Faithful:</strong> Reliable and consistent in their relationship with God and with others. Faithful people show up, serve, and obey even when it’s hard. <span class="verse">(Luke 16:10, Proverbs 20:6)</span></li>
      <li><strong>Available:</strong> Available: Willing to make time for spiritual growth, community, and the mission of Christ. Availability is about prioritizing God over distractions and busyness. <span class="verse">(Isaiah 6:8, Matthew 4:19–20)</span></li>
      <li><strong>Committed:</strong> Wholeheartedly devoted to Christ and His mission. This is more than just showing up to group—it’s a lifestyle.

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <h3>Highs and Lows</h3>
    <p> A time to share life updates—both victories and struggles. <span class="verse">(Galatians 6:2, Romans 12:15)</span></p>
    <p> <strong>Highs: </strong>Praise reports and blessings experienced through God’s provision. <span class="verse">(Psalm 103:2, James 1:17)</span></p>
    <p> <strong>Lows: </strong>Honest prayer requests, challenges, and areas where we’re seeking God’s strength and wisdom. <span class="verse">(James 5:16, Psalm 34:17)</span></p>

    <h3>Ins and Outs</h3>
    <p>Scripture memory and evangelism reports. <span class="verse">(Psalm 119:11, Joshua 1:8, Mark 16:15, 1 Peter 3:15)</span></p>
    <p><strong>Ins: </strong>Scripture memory and application. Members will meditate on 1–2 verses every two weeks and reflect on how God is speaking through them and shaping their walk. <span class="verse">(Psalm 119:11, Joshua 1:8)</span></p>
    <p><strong>Outs: </strong>Evangelism reports—sharing gospel conversations, outreach efforts, and moments of stepping out in faith to make Christ known. <span class="verse">(Mark 16:15, 1 Peter 3:15)</span></p>

    <h3>HEAR Journal</h3>
    <p>o	Each member will engage with God’s Word using the HEAR method to deepen personal devotion and share what the Lord is teaching them. The HEAR method stands for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Highlight:</strong> Choose a specific verse or passage from your reading that stood out to you. Write it down word-for-word. <span class="verse">(Psalm 119:105)</span></li>
      <li><strong>Explain:</strong>  In your own words, explain what the passage means in context. What was the author’s intent? What is happening in the verses? <span class="verse">(2 Timothy 2:15)</span></li>
      <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Reflect on how this passage applies to your life today. What is God saying to you personally through this verse? <span class="verse">(James 1:22–25)</span></li>
      <li><strong>Respond:</strong> Write a short response to God. This could be a prayer, a commitment, or an action step you feel led to take. <span class="verse">(Romans 12:1, Psalm 19:14)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This journal method helps you not only understand Scripture but also hear from God and live out His truth.</p>

    <h2>Long-Term Goal</h2>

This multiplication model ensures that we are not just growing personally, but that we are reproducing faithful followers of Jesus who continue the mission.  <span class="verse">(Matthew 9:37–38, 2 Timothy 2:2)</span></p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <q>What if I’ve never shared the gospel before?</q>
    <p>That’s okay! This group is designed to equip and encourage you. You’ll learn through practice, support, and example. <span class="verse">(Matthew 10:19–20)</span></p>

    <q>Do I have to lead a DE Group after this?</q>
    <p>We strongly encourage every member to multiply what they’ve learned by starting a group. You won’t be alone—we will equip you step-by-step. However, if you don't feel ready or led to lead, you are welcome to rejoin this group or participate in another DE Group. <span class="verse">(2 Timothy 2:2)</span></p>

    <q>What if I miss a session?</q>
    <p>Life happens. Let someone in the group know and catch up as best as you can. We’re here to grow together, not to be perfect. </p>

    <q>Can I invite others?</q>
    <p>Yes! We welcome others who are willing to commit to the group’s values and rhythms. However, to maintain depth and relationship, the group will stay within 5–7 members. Anyone new must understand this is not a casual Bible study, but a commitment to Christ-centered discipleship and evangelism. </p>

    <q>How long does the group last?</q>
    <p>The length depends on the book we choose to go through. We typically meet every other week and cover 1–2 chapters per session. The group continues until we complete the book together. </p>
